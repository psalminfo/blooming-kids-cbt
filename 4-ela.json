          "title": "Chewing Gum Man",
          "content": "Juicy. Sticky. Bubble. Pop!\n\nFor more than 100 years, chewing a tasty piece of gum has been a pleasure that most children and adults have enjoyed. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a world today without grocery store check-out counters lined with colorful packages of minty or fruit-flavored gum. Yet if a young salesman named William Wrigley, Jr., hadn't had such a clever idea to boost sales, gum might not be the popular treat it is today.\n\nWrigley was born in 1862. His father was a soap maker from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wrigley's first job as a teenager was selling soap for his father. Wrigley discovered that he was a good salesperson. He could make people believe that a product was special and that it might make their lives better.\n\nIn 1891, Wrigley moved to Chicago with the dream of starting his own business. He didn't start with gum, though. He decided to sell a product he knew a lot about: soap. To encourage people to buy his soap, Wrigley offered a gift. Each person who bought soap would get free baking powder. Soon people were asking for the baking powder more than the soap. So Wrigley switched to selling baking powder, and again he gave away a small gift with each purchase. This time he gave away gum.\n\nWrigley's customers loved the gum and kept asking for it. So Wrigley decided to start his own gum business. Wrigley believed that good advertising would help make his business successful. He placed advertisements in newspapers. He also gave gifts, such as clocks or fishing gear, to store owners who ordered gum. The more gum they ordered, the bigger the gift would be. In addition, Wrigley asked store owners to display boxes of his gum next to their cash registers. This way customers would see the gum when they paid for their items. Wrigley hoped that when customers saw the gum, they would decide to buy it.\n\nIn 1907 business was bad for many companies across the nation. In order to continue selling his gum, Wrigley had to work extra hard, think creatively, and take some risks. He took out a large personal loan to pay for advertising. If this idea had not worked, he would have lost everything. Wrigley believed that the public would buy his gum if it was something they thought about often. He wanted people to hear about his gum, read about it, see it, and taste it. His motto for selling gum was 'Tell 'em quick and tell 'em often.' Once, Wrigley went so far as to mail gum to every listed address in the country. More than a million people got to try Wrigley's gum for free.\n\nWrigley wanted people everywhere to continue thinking about his gum. When Wrigley died in 1932, his son Philip took over the company. Philip developed another plan to help achieve this goal. In 1939 the company began to advertise Wrigley's Doublemint gum using the Doublemint Twins. It hoped that whenever people saw the advertisement with the smiling, happy twins, they would think about Doublemint gum and want some. And that meant Wrigley's company sold more of its fresh, minty gum.\n\nThroughout his career, Wrigley was a determined salesman. Because of his ideas, millions of people enjoy chewing gum.",

          "title": "from Because of Winn-Dixie",
          "author": "by Kate DiCamillo",
          "content": "Winn-Dixie was not allowed to come inside the store (there was a big sign on the door that said NO DOGS ALLOWED), so I held the collar and the leash up to the window. And Winn-Dixie, who was standing on the other side of the window, pulled up his lip and showed me his teeth and sneezed and wagged his tail something furious; so I knew he absolutely loved that leash and collar combination. But it was very expensive.\n\nI decided to explain my situation to the man behind the counter. I said, 'I don't get a big enough allowance to afford something this fancy. But I love this collar and leash, and so does my dog, and I was thinking that maybe you could set me up on an installment plan.'\n\n'Installment plan?' said the man.\n\n'Gertrude!' somebody screamed in a real irritating voice.\n\nI looked around. It was a parrot. She was sitting on top of one of the fish tanks, looking right at me.\n\n'An installment plan,' I said, ignoring the parrot, 'you know, where I promise to give you my allowance every week and you give me the leash and the collar now.'\n\n'I don't think I can do that,' said the man. He shook his head. 'No, the owner, she wouldn't like that.' He looked down at the counter. He wouldn't look at me. He had thick black hair, and it was slicked back. He had on a name tag that said OTIS.\n\n'Or I could work for you,' I said. 'I could come in and sweep the floors and dust the shelves and take out the trash. I could do that.'\n\nI looked around Gertrude's Pets. There was sand and sunflower-seed shells and big dust bunnies all over the floor. I could tell that it needed to be swept.\n\n'Uh,' said Otis. He looked down at the counter some more.\n\n'Gertrude!' the parrot screamed again.\n\n'I'm real trustworthy,' I said. 'But the only thing is, Winn-Dixie, my dog, he would have to come inside with me; because if we get separated for too long, he starts to howl something terrible.'\n\n'Gertrude doesn't like dogs,' said Otis.\n\n'Is she the owner?' I asked.\n\n'Yes, I mean, no, I mean . . .' He finally looked up. He pointed at the fish tank. 'That Gertrude. The parrot. I named her after the owner.'\n\n'Gertrude's a pretty bird!' screamed Gertrude.\n\n'She might like Winn-Dixie,' I told Otis. 'Almost everybody does. Maybe he could come inside and meet her, and if the two of them get along, then could I have the job?'\n\n'Maybe,' Otis mumbled. He looked down at the counter again.\n\nSo I went and opened the door, and Winn-Dixie came trotting on inside the store.\n\n'Dog!' screamed Gertrude.\n\n'I know it,' Otis told her.\n\nAnd then Gertrude got real quiet. She sat on the top of the fish tank and cocked her head from one side to the other, looking at Winn-Dixie. And Winn-Dixie stood and stared back at her. He didn't hardly move. He didn't wag his tail. He didn't smile. He didn't sneeze. He just stared at Gertrude and she stared at him. And then she spread her wings out real far and flew and landed on top of Winn-Dixie's head.\n\n'Dog,' she croaked.\n\nWinn-Dixie wagged his tail just a little tiny bit.\n\nAnd Otis said, 'You can start on Monday.'\n\n'Thank you!' I told him. 'You won't be sorry.'\n\nOn the way out of Gertrude's Pets, I said to Winn-Dixie, 'You are better at making friends than anybody I have ever known.'"

          "title": "Night Flyers",
          "content": "Under the cover of darkness, millions of small, furry bats take flight and fill the night skies of Texas. There are 47 different species of bats in the United States, and 31 species live in Texas. The most common bat found throughout the state is the Mexican free-tailed bat. Each year 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats return to Bracken Cave near San Antonio, where they give birth and raise their young. Bracken Cave is home to the largest bat colony in the world.\n\nBat Benefits\n\nWhile bats seem mysterious or even scary to some, these night flyers are actually helpful creatures. Bats eat insects that can be harmful to plants, animals, and even people. A solitary bat can eat 1,000 mosquito-sized insects in just one hour. Bats also spread pollen among flowering plants. This allows plants to make seeds, and seeds make more plants. In addition, bats produce droppings that make excellent fertilizer. The fertilizer mixes with the soil and makes it richer, which helps plants grow. More plants mean more food for people and animals.\n\nGiving Back to Bats\n\nAs humans develop land and build new houses and businesses, bat habitats, like trees and caves, often are destroyed. Without homes, bats do not have a place to rest or to raise their young. Humans can help bats with this problem by providing bat houses. Today there are many people who build homes for bats.\n\nBecause bats sleep upside down, bat houses need to have something the bats can grab onto while they sleep. The houses must be painted black on the inside so that they are dark inside. This allows the bats to sleep comfortably during the day. Bat houses should also have access to water and plants so that the bats have something to eat and drink. The houses should be located in high places so that they are off the ground, where predators can't reach them. Giving a bat a home is a great way to help these useful creatures.\n\nAlways remember that bats are wild animals, and never try to touch them.",

          "subtitle": "Articles for Young Scientists    June 2014",
          "content": "When people think of bees, they may also think of the sweet taste of the honey that bees make. However, some people may not know that bees help us in more ways than producing honey. Unfortunately, there aren't as many honeybees today as there were a few years ago.\n\nWhat's Happening to the Honeybees?\n\nWhen scientists realized that the honeybee population was declining, they tried to figure out why. They think there might be several reasons for this. They found that honeybees are not as healthy as they have been in the past. More honeybees are suffering from diseases and catching viruses from bugs. Scientists also learned that some areas where bees live have been turned into farms. The wildflowers and plants that bees feed on have been replaced with crops, which limits honeybees' access to nectar and pollen. Another problem for honeybees may be the chemicals that are used to protect crops. The chemicals are sprayed on the crops, but they spread to other plants and flowers that bees depend on to survive.\n\nWe Need Bees\n\nMany of the fruits and vegetables that humans and other animals eat cannot grow without the help of honeybees. Honeybees carry pollen among plants. The plants need pollen to grow and produce more seeds. Without the help of honeybees, we would not have as many of the plants we depend on for food.\n\nBees pollinate a wide variety of plants in the United States. They pollinate fruit trees, vegetable plants, and crops such as clover and alfalfa, which feed cows and other farm animals. Many people may not realize it, but honeybees are important to every living thing.\n\nHow Humans Can Help\n\nThere are some things humans can do to help honeybees. People can grow flowers and plants that honeybees like, such as cabbage, sunflowers, and strawberries. People can also build beehives so that more bees will live in their area. In fact, some schools have initiated beekeeping programs to teach students about bees and to provide homes for bees that pollinate local plants.\n\nIan Snyder, a student who participates in a beekeeping program in Pennsylvania, has the right idea. 'It's important to keep the bees alive so they can pollinate everything,' Ian said. 'It's part of the cycle of life.'",

          "title": "Tiny Libraries with Big Stories",
          "content": "Whack! Whack! Whack! The hammer pounds another nail into the wood. The box is almost finished. Whack! Whack! Whack! The hammer drives in the last nail. A roof is attached to the four sides. The box is then attached to a pole in the ground. Soon the finished wood box will be filled with books. Visitors will borrow books and donate new ones. This box of books works a bit like an ordinary library, with one major difference: it is tiny.\n\nThe First Little Free Library\n\nIn 2009 in Wisconsin, Todd Bol came up with an idea to honor his mother. Bol's mother had been a teacher who had loved reading. Bol wanted to share his mother's love of reading with others. He decided to build a wood box and fill it with books. He made it look like a tiny red schoolhouse because he knew his mother would appreciate that. Bol placed the box of books on a post in his front yard with a sign that read 'Free Books.'\n\nSoon Bol's neighbors noticed this tiny model of a schoolhouse. They began taking the books and replacing them with books of their own. This was the beginning of the Little Free Library. The tiny library allowed people the opportunity to 'check out' books day or night. It was always open. A library card was not needed. The books could be read and returned whenever. But this library didn't just provide books. It also helped build friendships and a sense of belonging among community members. As more and more people visited Bol's little library, they began talking with one another. They shared thoughts, ideas, and stories. They got to know one another. Everyone loved the little library. After all, as Bol says, 'It's a magic box with books.'\n\nThe Demand for More\n\nBol's friends and neighbors wanted little libraries of their own. Bol built several and gave them away. One of his friends, Rick Brooks, noticed that the libraries encouraged people to read. He believed that Bol's little libraries could benefit more than just local friends and neighbors. With these ideas in mind, Bol and Brooks came up with a plan to build more than 2,500 Little Free Libraries around the world.\n\nTheir goal was to build more libraries than Andrew Carnegie. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Carnegie donated millions of dollars to have public libraries built around the world. Like Carnegie, Bol and Brooks believed that books should be available to all people, no matter where they live or what their background is. To help achieve their goal, Bol and Brooks created a website that provides information about the Little Free Libraries and how people can establish little libraries of their own.\n\nBol often hears from new Little Free Library owners, who tell him how important the libraries are to their community. He says, 'People tell us all the time that they've met more people in a week than they have in a lifetime.'\n\nLisa Lopez is an excited owner of two Little Free Libraries. She is also an elementary school librarian from El Paso, Texas. She says, 'It's generated a lot of excitement about reading. Kids love it, but adults are using it, too. My goal is to spread them across El Paso.'\n\nThanks to Bol and Brooks, the Little Free Libraries are encouraging people to read more and to be friendlier. Today there are more than 25,000 Little Free Libraries around the world, and they can be found on almost every continent.\n\nYou Can, Too\n\nFinished reading that book? Looking for another book to read? Perhaps there's a Little Free Library where you live. If not, maybe there will be one soon. After all, it only takes some wood, a hammer, a few nails, and some books.\n\nStart a Library in Your Neighborhood\n\nAnyone can start a little library. If you want to start one in your neighborhood, follow these helpful steps.\n\nMake a Plan\nDiscuss your idea with a parent or guardian. Explain what you want to do and how you will do it. Decide where the library will be located. Get permission to set up the library in the chosen location.\n\nBuild the Box\nBuild or buy a box that will hold books. It is helpful if the box has a shelf or two. You may want to include a door that opens and closes to help protect the books from rain. Finally, you can paint and decorate your library box.\n\nJust Add Books\nSort through your old books and select some to put in the library. Ask friends and neighbors to donate some, too. Fill the little library with books, and the readers will come.\n\nVisit the Little Free Library website for more information and great tips.",
