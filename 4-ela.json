            {"paragraph": 2, "text": "For more than 100 years, chewing a tasty piece of gum has been a pleasure that most children and adults have enjoyed. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a world today without grocery store check-out counters lined with colorful packages of minty or fruit-flavored gum. Yet if a young salesman named William Wrigley, Jr., hadn't had such a clever idea to boost sales, gum might not be the popular treat it is today."},
            {"paragraph": 3, "text": "Wrigley was born in 1862. His father was a soap maker from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wrigley's first job as a teenager was selling soap for his father. Wrigley discovered that he was a good salesperson. He could make people believe that a product was special and that it might make their lives better."},
            {"paragraph": 4, "text": "In 1891, Wrigley moved to Chicago with the dream of starting his own business. He didn't start with gum, though. He decided to sell a product he knew a lot about: soap. To encourage people to buy his soap, Wrigley offered a gift. Each person who bought soap would get free baking powder. Soon people were asking for the baking powder more than the soap. So Wrigley switched to selling baking powder, and again he gave away a small gift with each purchase. This time he gave away gum."},
            {"paragraph": 5, "text": "Wrigley's customers loved the gum and kept asking for it. So Wrigley decided to start his own gum business. Wrigley believed that good advertising would help make his business successful. He placed advertisements in newspapers. He also gave gifts, such as clocks or fishing gear, to store owners who ordered gum. The more gum they ordered, the bigger the gift would be. In addition, Wrigley asked store owners to display boxes of his gum next to their cash registers. This way customers would see the gum when they paid for their items. Wrigley hoped that when customers saw the gum, they would decide to buy it."},

            {"paragraph": 6, "text": "In 1907 business was bad for many companies across the nation. In order to continue selling his gum, Wrigley had to work extra hard, think creatively, and take some risks. He took out a large personal loan to pay for advertising. If this idea had not worked, he would have lost everything. Wrigley believed that the public would buy his gum if it was something they thought about often. He wanted people to hear about his gum, read about it, see it, and taste it. His motto for selling gum was 'Tell 'em quick and tell 'em often.' Once, Wrigley went so far as to mail gum to every listed address in the country. More than a million people got to try Wrigley's gum for free."},
            {"paragraph": 7, "text": "Wrigley wanted people everywhere to continue thinking about his gum. When Wrigley died in 1932, his son Philip took over the company. Philip developed another plan to help achieve this goal. In 1939 the company began to advertise Wrigley's Doublemint gum using the Doublemint Twins. It hoped that whenever people saw the advertisement with the smiling, happy twins, they would think about Doublemint gum and want some. And that meant Wrigley's company sold more of its fresh, minty gum."},
            {"paragraph": 8, "text": "Throughout his career, Wrigley was a determined salesman. Because of his ideas, millions of people enjoy chewing gum."}

There are 47 different species of bats in the United States, and 31 species live in Texas. The most common bat found throughout the state is the Mexican free-tailed bat. Each year 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats return to Bracken Cave near San Antonio, where they give birth and raise their young. Bracken Cave is home to the largest bat colony in the world."},

            {"paragraph": 2, "text": "While bats seem mysterious or even scary to some, these night flyers are actually helpful creatures. Bats eat insects that can be harmful to plants, animals, and even people. A solitary bat can eat 1,000 mosquito-sized insects in just one hour. Bats also spread pollen among flowering plants. This allows plants to make seeds, and seeds make more plants. In addition, bats produce droppings that make excellent fertilizer. The fertilizer mixes with the soil and makes it richer, which helps plants grow. More plants mean more food for people and animals."},

Without homes, bats do not have a place to rest or to raise their young. Humans can help bats with this problem by providing bat houses. Today there are many people who build homes for bats."},
            {"paragraph": 4, "text": "Because bats sleep upside down, bat houses need to have something the bats can grab onto while they sleep. The houses must be painted black on the inside so that they are dark inside. This allows the bats to sleep comfortably during the day. Bat houses should also have access to water and plants so that the bats have something to eat and drink. The houses should be located in high places so that they are off the ground, where predators can't reach them. Giving a bat a home is a great way to help these useful creatures."},

            {"paragraph": 2, "text": "When scientists realized that the honeybee population was declining, they tried to figure out why. They think there might be several reasons for this. They found that honeybees are not as healthy as they have been in the past. More honeybees are suffering from diseases and catching viruses from bugs. Scientists also learned that some areas where bees live have been turned into farms. The wildflowers and plants that bees feed on have been replaced with crops, which limits honeybees' access to nectar and pollen. Another problem for honeybees may be the chemicals that are used to protect crops. The chemicals are sprayed on the crops, but they spread to other plants and flowers that bees depend on to survive."},

The plants need pollen to grow and produce more seeds. Without the help of honeybees, we would not have as many of the plants we depend on for food."},
